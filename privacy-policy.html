    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: February 25, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Auto Screen Translate ("we", "our", "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Android application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.</strong></p>
    <p>The app performs all text recognition (OCR) and translation entirely on your device using Google ML Kit's on-device models. No screen content, text, or translations are ever sent to external servers.</p>

    <h2>Screen Capture</h2>
    <p>The app uses Android's MediaProjection API to capture screenshots for text recognition. Screenshots are processed locally on your device in real-time and are not saved, stored, or transmitted anywhere. Screen captures are immediately discarded after the text has been extracted and translated.</p>

    <h2>Translation History</h2>
    <p>Translation history is stored locally on your device using a local database. This data never leaves your device and can be cleared at any time from the app's settings.</p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. Google AdMob may collect certain data as described in <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>Usage data related to ad interactions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising through your device's settings under Google Ads settings.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requires the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Display over other apps</strong> — to show the floating translation bubble and overlay</li>
        <li><strong>Screen capture</strong> — to capture screen content for text recognition</li>
        <li><strong>Internet</strong> — to download translation models (one-time) and display ads</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications</strong> — to show the foreground service notification while translating</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all processing happens on-device, your data remains on your phone at all times. We have no servers and no access to any of your content.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The app is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>
